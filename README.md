## Project Idea:

A mobile app to determine Quality of Speech
Outcome : The expected outcome is to build cross platform mobile app to determine Quality of Speech in English and any Indian Language (Kannada).

We capture the name of the speaker, topic, date and time, location before starting. This app will be used by the person who wants to evaluate the speech of other persons, or can be his own too. The speaker has to record his speech in the app. He can play the recording and listen to it too. While the speaker is recording his speech, the evaluator must tap on the crutch words that the speaker is using in his speech. Once the recording is done, the evaluator can stop the recording. In the next activity, the evaluator can see the number of crutch words used in the form of a pie chart. So, once the data of multiple speakers is captured, there are some more charts comparing the speaker with other speakers and also a chart showing how the speaker is doing over a period of time (to find out if they're improving or not).
